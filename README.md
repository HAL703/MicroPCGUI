# MicroPCGUI

1. Replaced usage of FactoryTalk software with a custom-made GUI serving the same purpose
2. This was designed so that the customer wouldn't have to go between two or three different windows while trying to test equipment
3. Developed in C# using MetroFramework and Windows Forms
4. Gained experience in user-defined types (UDT)
5. Linked C# to an Allen-Bradley PLC using INGEAR drivers


This also contains several INGEAR projects I made, a few are GUIs.
